# Laplace_code

The main file is the Laplace_code jupyter notebook. It has the code to recreate Figures 3, 5 and A.1 from the paper, explained with comments in the notebook. It also recreates the example used in the video presentation of the paper.

In all cases, the code consists of three steps: 

1. The TD backups of the corresponding MP.
2. Plotting the gamma-space.
3. Recovering the tau-space with the SVD approximation and plotting it.

If GitHub cannot preview the Jupyter notebook (message 'Sorry, something went wrong. Reload'), copy the url link of the .ipynb file and open it in https://nbviewer.jupyter.org.
